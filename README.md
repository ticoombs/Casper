## Branch - slowbro-live

Exact copy of my running theme, mainly for my own backup

The default theme for my [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) installation on [Slowb.ro](https://blog.slowb.ro).

To install my theme either:

```
git clone  https://github.com/ticoombs/seobro your-ghost-install/content/themes/seobro
```

or

```
cd ghost-install-dir/content/themes
curl -LOk https://github.com/ticoombs/seobro/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip -d seobro

```
